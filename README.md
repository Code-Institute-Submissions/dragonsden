# Dragon's Den Designs
[Dragon's Den](thorole.github.io/dragonsden)

Dragon's Den Designs is a website for dedicated table-top rpg players who want to lift their game to the next level. The designers at Dragons Den
specialize in designing artwork for fantasy settings and make custom artwork, tailored after the customer's demands.
 
## UX
 
The owners of the website recognize that there's a demand and a market for custom artwork for table-top role playing games.
Players are looking for professional and customized designs of their characters, monsters, sceneries, maps etc.., in contrast
to generic artwork that comes with the games. It is important for the owners of the website that the artwork itself is in focus
and gets the most attention. Furthermore it's also key for the owners that navigating between the three main parts of the
website never require more than one click.

### User Stories


- Upon entering the website, I can immediately see a big hero image with at text label, telling me what what Dragon's Den 
Designs do.

- I want to be able to easily locate the navigation bar, so that I can navigate directly to the content I wish to view. The
links in the navigation bar are self explanatory.

- On the landing page, I want to to be able to get a quick overview of what Dragon's Den Designs offer, so that I can can decide
if this is something for me. I also want to be able to jump straight to the contact page from the bottom of the landing page.

- As a potential customer, I want to be able to view some example artwork made by the artists behind the website. The example
artwork should be organized into two categories, so that I can get the impression that the artists can handle different types
of artwork.

- I should be able to reach the contact page with a single click from anywhere on the website.

- The contact page should have a form which has fields that I am required to fill in. Some fields should also check that my 
input is in the correct format, like the field for the e-mail address.



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

The site is divided into three pages which are all meaningful on their own, meaning, for instance, that the user is not rquired to 
read everything on the landing page to enjoy or understand what's going on in the gallery or contact pages. 

### Existing Features
- About Us - This page, which is also the landing page, allows the user to get an impression of what the website can offer
by reading and viewing images. It's structured as a walkthrough of the process from where the costumer presents and idea and up to the 
point where the artwork is finished. At the bottom of this page there's a dramatic image to showcase what such artwork may look
like when it's finished. 
- Gallery - The Gallery page offers example art for the user to view. All of the thumbnails opens up in a modal for able
larger view of the image. This section is also split into two categories:
   - Creatures
   - Sceneries

This way the user can see that the artists master different kinds of motives.

- Contact Us - This page presents the user with a form. The form asks the user about relevant information
such as name, contact information and a textfield where the user can freely express her-/himself.
The form also asks for optional information about how the user came across the site. This should be usefulfor the 
owners.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- The artists behind Dragons's Den are also hosting workshops for people who want to learn to design
their own art. In the feature there will be a page dedicated to a schedule of these workshops.

- The gallery will be divided into more sections: Characters, cities, maps etc.

- Fixed price packages. For instance: 4 character designs, 1 world map, 1 city map - 100$.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- The project is written in HTML5 and CSS3

- [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com)
    - The project uses bootstrap for large parts of the layout.

- The project uses JavaScript from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp) in the gallery section to make
images display in modal when clicked. Some of the script was modified by the author of Dragon's Den Designs
to fit the project.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Landing-page
    1. Clicked all links in navbar, including brand, to make sure the user is directed to the correct section/page: success
    2. Clicked contact link at bottom of landing page to make sure user is directed to contact page: success
    3. Clicked contact link at bottom of landing page to make sure user is directed to contact page: success
    4. Clicked "backt to top" link at bottom of landing page to make sure user is directed to top of landing page: success.
    5. Redused screen size to check that page displays in single column on smaller screens: success

1. Gallery
    1. Clicked all links in navbar, including brand, to make sure the user is directed to the correct section/page: success
    2. Clicked all images to make sure the open in modal: success
    3. Modal closes by clicking anywhere on modal: success
    4. Redused screen size to make sure gallery displays in two columns instead of four columns on smaller screens: success

1. Contact page
    1. Try to submit

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
